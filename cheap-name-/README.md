go build

then

```
./cheap-name -selector 'tuple(address,address)'
this is good enough - can do ctrl-c now use this as your signature abdlmhjnfgkice(tuple(address,address)) found after 1m8.910767404s 0x0000003f
```

more exmaples:
```
./cheap-name -selector 'uint256'
this is good enough - can do ctrl-c now use this as your signature ifdgekjhacb(uint256) found after 16.687756584s 0x0000008b
```

or whatever you need as selector but without the function name,
